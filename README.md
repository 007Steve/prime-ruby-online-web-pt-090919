# Implementing Prime

First, do not use any other ruby library, you must build a method that can verify whether a number is prime. Don't `require 'math'` and just piggyback off their implementation of prime.

Second, feel free to research algorithms for checking to see if a number is prime.

Third, think about the efficiency of your algorithm. How many iterations does it do?

# Bonus

Look into Benchmarking in Ruby and profile a few different approaches to prime.
