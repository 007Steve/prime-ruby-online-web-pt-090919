# Implementing Prime

## Objectives

1. Practice iteration and looping
2. Practice defining methods and controlling return values

## Instructions 

Fork and clone this repository. Run the test suite to learn what is required of you. 

You'll be defining a method, `prime?`, that takes in an argument of a number and returns true if that number is prime and false if it is not. 

A few things to think about:

* What makes something a prime number? Research algorithms for checking to see if a number is prime
* How do you create a range of numbers? How do you turn a range into an array so that it can be interated over?

Requirements:

* Do not use any other ruby library, you must build a method that can verify whether a number is prime. Don't `require 'math'` and just piggyback off their implementation of prime number.

# Bonus

Think about the efficiency of your algorithm. How many iterations does it do? Look into Benchmarking in Ruby and profile a few different approaches to prime.
